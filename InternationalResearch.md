Mohit Chaurasiya nsut
- I started with working with a professor at my home institution NSIT. Then, I applied to a Summer Research Program at UVA, got selected for that and worked for another 2 months. Later on, I contacted to a professor from NUS whose work has been a big inspiration to me, showed him my past projects and shared my experience in the field, got an intern position under his guidance and we are currently working on a research project together. Lastly, my instructor at NUS has been a post doctoral researcher at CGA, Harvard University and had a few papers with faculty of TH Chan School of Public policy and Health, Harvard University, I got an opportunity to join another position for their upcoming research project along my research interests.
